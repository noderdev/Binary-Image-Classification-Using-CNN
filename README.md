The CNN.ipynb notebook contains Binary classification of images of Food and Non Food items using CNN architecture in Tensorflow.
The code comprises of hyper parameter tuning as well which was analyzed using tensorboard.There are also comparisons of model's performance using Image Augmentation as well. The code also shows how to use a pre trained model VGG-16 for binary classification. 
Keep he following points in mind when trying to run the code :-
1. Make sure to have tensorflow 2.0 >= installed. Install sklearn, numpy , matplotli.
2. If the tensor board does not display, run the notebook in firefox browser.
3. The code can be run with any binary classification image dataset (slight adjustment might be required)
